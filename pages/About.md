<h7><b>Let's face it Rotary is struggling. Rotary is losing it's relevancy in today's modern world especially when the average age of a Rotarian in 58 years old. the organisation has not adapted to fit into changing generational expectations and now we face an amazing organisation being pushed to the sidelines.</b></h7> As the world's largest service organisation, Rotary needs to be at the cutting edge of service organisations. It needs to retain the core Rotary values but show the world how professional development, volunteering, leadership and networking can be achieved through one flexible, acessible, engaged and active organisation. How do we make Rotary relevant again? We have to Rethink Rotary starting at the club level. I found myself spending so much time pondering this dilema that I decided to take action. Rethink Rotary was created with the vision of providing a space where we can have a conversation on how to make clubs more relevant and engaged. Hang on though, we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s start from the beginning.

<h3><b>Learning the ropes in Rotaract</b></h3>
Originally from England, she got involved with Rotary when she moved to Canada to attend University. Katie got involved with Rotaract in Ontario then in Victoria, British Columbia. During her time with the Rotaract Club of Victoria, Katie served as co-president and chaired various committees. When she wasn’t active with the Rotaract club she working hard towards a BSc in Linguistics. Katie graduated with honours and a presidential citation in 2013. She was also passionate about volunteering with nonprofits focused on stroke recovery and speech therapy.

<h3><b>What do I do now?</b></h3>
After graduating, Katie faced the question that many graduates ask themselves: “What do I do now?” Passionate about nonprofits and Rotary, she realised that she always approached these amazing organisations from the standpoint of how can they market themselves better or increase their online content to become even more successful. It seemed perfectly logical especially with her linguistic background and passion for language, to develop her skills as an online content manager and brand marketing advisor for nonprofits and small companies. Some clients include: Be Fit Victoria, Creative Sign Design to name a few. 

<h3><b>Hang on, something isn't right here!</b></h3>
In 2014, while still active in Rotaract as past-president she started thinking about her future in Rotary. She noticed a big problem, there were plenty of Rotaractors who once they graduated or felt too old to continue Rotaract just left the Rotary family never to return. Why weren't they joining established Rotary clubs? Why was there such a disconnect between these clubs and younger potential members? So along with fellow Rotaractor Brianna Green, Katie decided to start a new Rotary club in Victoria one which focused on being flexible, economical, active and accessible for all who want to join Rotary. Katie was able to use her expertise to develop a new look Rotary <a href="https://www.victoriarotary.com">website</a> for the club which focused on being an advertising tool rather than losing its message by being both a member focused and advertising tool website.  

<h3><b>Rethink Rotary is formed</b></h3>
During her time creating and tackling the reasoning behind creating the club, Katie felt the need to be documenting her experiences and research just to preserve it for any Rotarians out there who might be interested in working on changing their clubs. Along with her expertise with online content management and brand marketing, she created Rethink Rotary. First, came Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/RethinkRotary">@rethinkrotary</a> where tweets are based on encouraging all Rotary clubs and Rotarians to start a conversation by questioning how they and their clubs do Rotary. It has been a fantastic way to engage with other Rotarians and clubs who are questioning, challenging and implementing changes. However, she also found that there were plenty of Rotarians and Rotary clubs out there who wanted to change but didn’t know how to start. Through twitter exchanges and emails with Rotarians and Rotary clubs all over the world, it appeared that people were looking for help but didn't know where to turn for the right Rotary specific advice. To be of more service, Katie decided to launch a Rethink Rotary blog where she could use her knowledge and expertise to provide a go to spot for Rotarians and Rotary club looking for advice about changing how their club works, improving their online content and brand marketing.

<h3><b>Reach out</b></h3>
Katie loves to hear from Rotarians and Rotary club from all over the world.

For us to work to make Rotary relevant to the world we live in, we have to start a conversation. Now's the time
