<blockquote>"If Rotary is to realize it's proper destiny, it must be evolutionary at all times, revolutionary on occasions" - Paul Harris</blockquote> 
Rotary is struggling to keep up with the changing needs of different generations. We live in an online, fast paced, changeable world. Your club has to produce meaningful online content to stand a chance to compete. I can help use the skills I have developed in my work as an online content manager and my experience with Rotary to provide necessary and useful services to any Rotary club. There are plently of future Rotarians out there, they just don't know it yet.

	<h3>Website Building</h3>
	<p>I have experience in creating html, css and wordpress websites. Depending on the needs of your Rotary club, I can work with you to create the website your club needs. Some clubs simply want a landing page for potential members. Other clubs want a more interactive site usually (but not always) built from Clubrunner or Dacdb. In these instances, I can work with the front-end code to create a great looking website.</p>

	<h3>Online Content Manager</h3>
	<p>Greating online content is an art and requires great skill. You can't simply just post on Facebook or Twitter, you have to cultivate an online schedule and create material which has online value. An online content manager does the work for you so you don't have to worry. I can work with your club to create strategies and action plans to ensure your club's objectives are met across all social media mediums. </p>

	<h3>Training/Workshops</h3>
	<p>I like to get members focusing on why they joined Rotary, distilling those core values, then helping implement those values in social media. These workshops serve as an way for members to  be comfortable in what social media is about and what role it can play for their club.</p>

	<h3>Club Health Check</h3>
	<p>Sometimes you have the right ideas you just don't know how to implement them. This is where I can help. I can offer advice on your club's online content and make sure you are on the right track.</p>
