<blockquote>"If Rotary is to realize it's proper destiny, it must be evolutionary at all times, revolutionary on occasions" - Paul Harris</blockquote> 
Rotary is struggling to keep up with the changing needs of different generations. We live in an online, fast paced and changeable world. Your club has to produce meaningful online content to stand a chance to compete. I can help use the skills I have developed in my work as an online content manager and my experience with Rotary to provide necessary and useful services to any Rotary club. I want to train Rotarians all over the world to learn these essential skills to better their clubs and Rotary as a whole. There are plently of future Rotarians out there, they just don't know it yet.

	<h3>Website Building</h3>
	<p>I have experience in creating html, css and wordpress websites. Depending on the needs of a Rotary club, I work with them to create the website their club needs. Some clubs simply want a landing page for potential members. Other clubs want a more interactive site usually (but not always) built from Clubrunner or Dacdb. In these instances, I work with the front-end code to create a great looking website.</p>

	<h3>Online Content</h3>
	<p>Creating online content is an art and requires great skill. You can't simply just post on Facebook or Twitter, you have to cultivate an online audience and create material which has online value. An online content manager does the work for you so you don't have to worry. I can work with your club to create strategies and action plans to ensure your club's objectives are met across all social media mediums.</p>

	<h3>Training/Workshops</h3>
	<p>Teaching your club members the skills to manage your club's online presence is essential. I like to focus on two key areas in my training. First, teaching basic skills such as html, css and website marketing focused on showcasing your Rotary club in the best way. Second, I like to get members focusing on why they joined Rotary, distilling those core values, then helping implement those values into your club's social media strategy. These workshops serve as a way for members to be comfortable in what social media is about and what role it can play for their club.</p>

	<h3>Consultant</h3>
	<p>Sometimes you have the right ideas you just don't know how to implement them. This is where I can help. I have provided for Rotary clubs a 'Health Check' which involves an analysis of your club's online presence and provides a report and suggestions for improvements. If you know your club needs help in a particular area, I offer advice and make sure you are on the right track.</p>
